> As there is no official API and Xiaomi does not support third-party integration, being able to add a device to the Homey app depends on an existing integration, online documentation or donating the device to the developer. If neither of these can be fulfilled then integration is not possible.

### Supply the device details
* **Name:** << The name of the device >>
* **Model ID:** << brand.type.id, for instance zhimi.airpurifier.mc1, can also be found using token extraction tool (see wiki) >>
* **MIoT spec:** << find the link to the specs of this device on this website: https://home.miot-spec.com/ >>

### Current support
<< Have you tested an existing driver based on the currently supported devices list (see wiki) and what was the result / error / missing functionality? >>

### Additional information
<< Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. >>
